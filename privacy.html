<h2>Introduction</h2>

	The Services are operated by Pizza GoGo Limited (&quot;Pizza GoGo&quot;, the &quot;Company&quot;, &quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot;) for customers of the Services (&quot;You&quot;).

<h2>What information do we collect?</h2>

</p>
<p>
	The data we collect and store is your postal address, email, telephone number and date of birth

	however we do not have any access to your card number, expiry date or CVV number. This
	information is handled and protected by Globalpay.
</p>
<p>
	We may request personal data from publicly available sources and/or from third party data vendors.
	If we do this, we will ensure that the data provided has been collected and shared with us only if the
	GDPR regulations and guidelines have been followed when collecting that data.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	<b>c. Aggregated information:</b> In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve our customers of the Services, we may conduct research on our customer 
	demographics, interests and behaviour based on the information collected. We may also disclose aggregated and anonymized user statistics in order to describe 
	our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
</p>
